Distributed Bitcoin Miner
==

An implementation of a distributed Bitcoin miner along with the Live Sequence Protocol, a homegrown protocol for providing reliable communication with simple client and server APIs on top of the Internet UDP protocol.


### Compiling the `client`, `miner` & `server` programs

To compile the `client`, `miner`, and `server` programs, use the `go install` command
as follows (these instructions assume your
`GOPATH` is pointing to the project's root `p1/` directory):

```bash
# Compile the client, miner, and server programs. The resulting binaries
# will be located in the $GOPATH/bin directory.
go install github.com/cmu440/bitcoin/client
go install github.com/cmu440/bitcoin/miner
go install github.com/cmu440/bitcoin/server

# Start the server, specifying the port to listen on.
$GOPATH/bin/server 6060

# Start a miner, specifying the server's host:port.
$GOPATH/bin/miner localhost:6060

# Start the client, specifying the server's host:port, the message
# "bradfitz", and max nonce 9999.
$GOPATH/bin/client localhost:6060 bradfitz 9999
```

Note that you will need to use the `os.Args` variable in your code to access the user-specified
command line arguments.
